This assignment proved to be the most difficult so far for me.


I discovered in my analysis is that school spending appears to be inversely correlated with test scores.
Students attending charter schools tended to do better than students attending district schools.
Large schools had the lowest overall passing in results in comparison to small or medium with medium sized schools having 
the highest overall passing.
